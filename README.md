# CSC413

*This repository stores work done by Hongyu Chen in CSC413*

CSC413 is the continueation of CSC311 taught at UofT, where we study,implement, and prove deep neural network structures and its applications.

**CSC413 Course Description:**

An introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Backpropagation and automatic differentiation. Architectures: convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks. Methods for improving optimization and generalization. Neural networks for unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

**Material taught in CSC413(on-going):**

Python(Numpy,Pandas,Torch)

Multi-Layer Percptron Neural Network(MLP)

Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
...

**Breakdown of Assignments:**

*Note: the breakdown gives keywords of what an assignment was on, and the keywords follow the same order as the question given in the assignment*

*A1:* In this assignment, we will make a neural network that can predict the next word in a sentence given the previous three. We will apply an idea called weight sharing to go beyond multi-layer perceptrons with only fully-connected layers.

*A2:* In this assignment, we will build a convolutional neural network that can predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or from two different pairs. This kind of application can have real-world applications: for example to help people who are visually impaired to have more independence.

*A3:* In this assignment, we’ll explore a more advanced use of deep learning on a natural language process (NLP) task involving news headlines. In particular, we’ll be working with a dataset of Reuters news headlines collected over a span of 15 months, covering some of 2018, 2019, and early 2020. This assignment will combine several of the concepts that we discussed in class, including recurrent neural networks, data augmentation, autoencoders (soon), and working with embeddings.
