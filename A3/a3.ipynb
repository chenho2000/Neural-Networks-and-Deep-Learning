    "# CSC413 Assignment 3. Text Denoising Autoencoder for News Headlines\n",

    "\n",
    "**Submission**: Submit a PDF report containing your code, outputs,\n",
    "and your written solutions.\n",
    "You may export the completed notebook, but if you do so\n",
    "**it is your responsibly to make sure that your code and answers do not get cut off**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late Submission**: Please see the syllabus for the late submission criteria.\n",

    "**Working with a partner**: You may work with a partner for this assignment.\n",
    "If you decide to work with a partner, please create your group on Markus by\n",

    "In this assignment, we'll explore a more advanced use of deep learning on a\n",
    "natural language process (NLP) task involving news headlines. \n",
    "In particular, we'll be working with a dataset of Reuters news headlines\n",
    "collected over a span of 15 months, covering some of 2018, 2019, and early 2020.\n",
    "This assignment will combine several of the concepts that we discussed in class,\n",
    "including recurrent neural networks, data augmentation, autoencoders (soon), \n",
    "and working with embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, we'll be building an **autoencoder** of news headlines.\n",
    "We will build an **encoder** model that maps a news headline to a vector embedding,\n",
    "and a **decoder** that reconstructs the news headline. By building a model that\n",
    "learns to reconstruct the news headlines from the vector embedding, the model\n",
    "will learn good embeddings of these headlins.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see a similar idea with image autoencoders and image VAEs, but\n",
    "both our encoder and decoder networks will be Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",
    "You'll have a chance build networks that takes a sequence as an input,\n",
    "and a network that generates a sequence as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 1. Data exploration\n",
    "- Question 2. Background Math\n",
    "- Question 3. Building the autoencoder\n",
    "- Question 4. Training the autoencoder using *data augmentation*\n",
    "- Question 5. Analyzing the embeddings (interpolating between headlines)\n",
    "- Question 6. Work Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the idea behind this assignment is movtivated by Shen et al [1].\n",
    "We'll use the data augmentation rules proposed in that work to improve\n",
    "the robustness of the autoencoder.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"p4model.png\" width=\"95%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main components to the model: the **encoder** and the **decoder**.\n",
    "As always with neural networks, we'll first describe how to make\n",
    "**predictions** with of these components. Let's get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **encoder** will take a sequence of words (a headline) as *input*, and produce an\n",
    "embedding (a vector) that represents the entire headline. In the diagram above,\n",
    "the vector ${\\bf h}^{(7)}$ is the vector embedding containing information about \n",
    "the entire headline.  This portion is very similar\n",
    "to the sentiment analysis RNN that we discussed in lecture (but without the fully-connected\n",
    "layer that makes a prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **decoder** will take an embedding (in the diagram, the vector ${\\bf h}^{(7)}$) as input,\n",
    "and uses a separate RNN to **generate a sequence of words**. To generate a sequence of words,\n",
    "the decoder needs to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Determine the previous word that was generated. This previous word will act as ${\\bf x}^{(t)}$\n",
    "   to our RNN, and will be used to update the hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$. Since each of our\n",
    "   sequences begin with the `<bos>` token, we'll set ${\\bf x}^{(1)}$ to be the `<bos>` token.\n",
    "2) Compute the updates to the hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$ based on the previous hidden state\n",
    "   ${\\bf m}^{(t-1)}$ and ${\\bf x}^{(t)}$. Intuitively, this hidden state vector ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$\n",
    "   is a representation of *all the words we still need to generate*.\n",
    "3) We'll use a fully-connected layer to take a hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$, and determine\n",
    "   *what the next word should be*. This fully-connected layer solves a *classification problem*,\n",
    "   since we are trying to choose a word out of $K=10000$ distinct words. As in a classification\n",
    "   problem, the fully-connected neural network will compute a *probability distribution* over\n",
    "   these 10,000 words. In the diagram, we are using ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$ to represent the logits,\n",
    "   or the pre-softmax activation values representing the probability distribution.\n",
    "4) We will need to *sample* an actual word from this probability distribution ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$.\n",
    "   We can do this in a number of ways, which we'll discuss in question 4. For now, you can \n",
    "   imagine your favourite way of picking a word given a distribution over words.\n",
    "5) This word we choose will become the next input ${\\bf x}^{(t+1)}$ to our RNN, which is used\n",
    "   to update our hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t+1)}$---i.e. to determine what are the remaining\n",
    "   words to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can repeat this process until we see an `<eos>` token generated, or until the generated\n",
    "sequence becomes too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we can't *train* this autoencoder in the way we just described. That is,\n",
    "we can't just compare our generated sequence with our ground-truth sequence, and get\n",
    "gradients. Both sequences are **discrete** entities, so we won't be able to compute\n",
    "gradients at all! In particular, **sampling is a discrete process**, and so we won't be\n",
    "able to back-propagate through any kind of sampling that we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder whether we can get away with computing gradients by comparing the\n",
    "distributions ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$ with the ground truth words at each time step. Like any\n",
    "multi-class classification problem, we can represent the ground-truth words as a one-hot\n",
    "vector, and use the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, we can do this. In practice, there are a few issues. One is that the generated\n",
    "sequence might be longer or shorter than the actual sequence, meaning that there may\n",
    "be more/fewer ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$s than ground-truth words. Another more insidious issue\n",
    "is that the **gradients will become very high-variance and unstable**, because\n",
    "**early mistakes will easily throw the model off-track**. Early in training,\n",
    "our model is unlikely to produce the right answer in step $t=1$, so the gradients\n",
    "we obtain based on the other time steps will not be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might have some ideas about \"hacks\" we can use to make training\n",
    "work. Fortunately, there is one very well-established solution called\n",
    "**teacher forcing** which we can use for training:\n",
    "instead of *sampling* the next word based on ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$, we will forgo sampling,\n",
    "and use the **ground truth** ${\\bf x}^{(t)}$ in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a diagram showing how we can use **teacher forcing** to train our model:\n",
